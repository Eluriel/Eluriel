# Hi, I'm Benjamin 👋

I built my first website in 2009 and have been working professionally as a Software Engineer since 2020.  
Most of my work is not open source, which is why this GitHub looks quieter than my actual activity — but behind the scenes, I’ve been contributing to large industrial systems, internal platforms, and technical tooling for many years.

## About Me

- **Frontend-focused engineer**, experienced with Vue.js, Vuetify, React, and TypeScript  
- **Full-stack capabilities** with Node.js, Python, Prisma, SQL and REST API development  
- **Experience in industrial and automation environments**, including vision systems, smart devices, and internal tooling  
- **DevOps and infrastructure background** with Docker, GitLab CI/CD, monitoring, and documentation systems  
- Strong interest in building clean architectures, reliable pipelines, and maintainable systems

## What I Work On

- Frontend applications for industrial products and internal tools  
- Backend APIs and services in Node.js and Python  
- CI/CD setup, automation scripts, and deployment pipelines  
- Monorepo structures for complex multi-application ecosystems  
- Documentation tooling and developer experience improvements  
- Side projects exploring new technologies (React, Next.js, Prisma, etc.)

## Current Focus

- Exploring new opportunities as a **frontend or full-stack engineer**  
- Lerning in-depth React and getting certified
- Improving my documentation and portfolio presence

## Technologies

**Frontend:** Vue.js, Vuetify, React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Backend:** Node.js, Python, Django, Prisma, SQL, Java  
**DevOps:** Docker, GitLab CI/CD, monitoring dashboards  
**Other:** C#, C/C++, Rust basics, Electron, Sphinx documentation
